Containerlab openness and focus on multivendor labs was a key to its success and adoption. With more than a dozen Network Operating Systems spread across several networking vendors and opensource teams, it is a tool that can answer the needs of a broad network engineers community.

## Discord Server
Growing the number of supported NOSes is a task that can't be done by a single person, and there the community role is adamant. To support and cherish the growing containerlab community and provide better feedback and discussions platform, we launched containerlab's own Discord server.

Everybody is welcome to join and chat with our community members about all things containerlab!

## In The Media
We are always happy to showcase containerlab and demonstrate its powers. Luckily, the network engineering community has lots of events worldwide, and we participated in some. Below you will find recordings of containerlab talks in different formats and on various venues listed in reverse chronological order[^1].

### NANOG 83
<small>:material-youtube: [Containerlab - running networking labs with Docker UX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigCla1qY3k) · :material-calendar: 2021-11-03</small>

Our very first NANOG appearance and we went full-steam there. This talk is the most comprehensive containerlab tutorial captured to that date. It starts with the basics and escalates to the [advanced DC fabric deployment](https://youtu.be/qigCla1qY3k?t=2131) with HA telemetry cluster created. All driven by a single containerlab topology file.

### Open Networking & Edge Summit 2021
<small>:material-youtube: [Containerlab - a Modern way to Deploy Networking Topologies for Labs, CI, and Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snQTlFahY1c) · :material-calendar: 2021-10-11</small>

This 30mins screencast introduces containerlab by going through a multivendor lab example consisting of Nokia SR Linux, Arista cEOS, and GoBGP containers participating in a route reflection scenario.

The talk starts with the reasoning as to why containerlab development was warranted and what features of container-based labs we wanted to have. Then we start building the lab step by step, explaining how the containerlab topology file is structured.

### Modem Podcast s01e10
<small>:material-youtube: [Containerlab: Declarative network labbing](https://www.modem.show/post/s01e10/) · :material-calendar: 2021-06-06</small>

Building large-scale network labs can be tedious and error-prone — More importantly, they can be notoriously hard to spin up automatically. Containerlab is a new tool that promises to “redefine the way you run networking labs”, and I really think it hits that target. On this episode of the Modulate Demodulate podcast, Nick and Chris C. are joined by Roman Dodin, one of the brains behind Containerlab.

### Multipoint Redistribution and SR Linux
<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://juliopdx.com/2022/01/22/multipoint-redistribution-and-sr-linux/) by [@JulioPDX](https://twitter.com/Julio_PDX) · :material-calendar: 2022-01-22</small>

I’ve been working my way through Optimal Routing Design by Russ White, Don Slice, and Alvaro Retana. It has been a great read so far and I highly recommend it. When I work through a book I usually try and lab up any concept I can, this helps me make it stick as much as possible. Early on in the book the authors mention redistribution and possible issues that can come with doing it at more than one point in the network. So here we are reading this post. I hope you enjoy and possibly learn something along the way.

A [blogpost](https://stubarea51.net/2021/12/20/network-modeling-automating-mikrotik-routeros-chr-containerlab-images/) showing how to build containerlab images for the Mikrotik CHR, and how you can avoid having to build them yourself using Docker.

### My Journey and Experience with Containerlab
<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://juliopdx.com/2021/12/10/my-journey-and-experience-with-containerlab/) by [@JulioPDX](https://twitter.com/Julio_PDX) · :material-calendar: 2021-12-10</small>

In [this blog](https://juliopdx.com/2021/12/10/my-journey-and-experience-with-containerlab/) Julio took containerlab for a spin and shares his experience with it. His lab consists of a few Arista cEOS nodes which he then provisions with Nornir, using [Ansible inventory](manual/inventory.md) generated by containerlab.

### Network Modeling: Segmented Lab access with Containerlab and ZeroTier
<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://stubarea51.net/2021/11/23/network-modeling-segmented-lab-access-with-containerlab-and-zerotier/) by [@nlgotz](https://twitter.com/nlgotz) · :material-calendar: 2021-11-23</small>

When building out network labs, often multiple people will need access to the lab. The main way right now is to use something like EVE-NG or GNS3 to provide access.

There are 2 downsides to this method. The first is that your server is exposed to the internet and if your usernames/passwords aren’t strong enough, your server can become compromised. The second is that sometimes you may not want everyone to be able to add or edit to the lab topology.

The solution to this is using Containerlab and ZeroTier. This setup is great for things like testing new hires, training classes, or for providing lab access to others on a limited basis.

### Building Your Own Data Center Fabric with Containerlab
<small>:material-text::material-youtube: [Blog](https://networkcloudandeverything.com/containerlab-post/) and a [screencast](https://youtu.be/d2f1SYRyj0I) by [Alperen Akpinar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alperenakpinar/) · :material-calendar: 2021-08-24</small>

Alperen did a great job explaining how to build a DC fabric topology using containerlab. This was the first post in the series, making it an excellent intro to containerlab, especially when you follow the [screencast](https://youtu.be/d2f1SYRyj0I) and watch the topology buildup live.

In a [subsequent post](https://networkcloudandeverything.com/configuring-srlinux-nodes-in-a-3-tier-data-center/), Alperen explains how to configure the SR Linux fabric he just built.

### How to consistently run a temporary VM on AWS to run Containerlab
<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://nleiva.medium.com/how-you-can-consistently-run-temporary-workloads-in-the-cloud-37140b4b5e55#8d6d) by [@_nleiva](https://twitter.com/_nleiva) · :material-calendar: 2021-07-12</small>

Create and then destroy a cloud environment ready to Containerlab with pre-loaded topology files, which just work if you use FRR and SR Linux. If you need to run Arista's cEOS, see: [Getting cEOS image](https://github.com/nleiva/aws-testbed/blob/main/lab/get_arista_ceos.md).

This post describes the benefits of running any temporary workload in the cloud to then focus on Containerlab, so skip to the “Network testing challenges” section if you want to get to the meat of it. More details on the labs included at [Network Labs](https://github.com/nleiva/aws-testbed/tree/main/lab#network-labs).
